## Decentralization
There are three main forms of decentralization, or how authority is transferred:

* **Architectural (de)centralization**  — how many physical computers is a system made up of? How many of those computers can it tolerate breaking down at any single time?

* **Political (de)centralization**  — how many individuals or organizations ultimately control the computers that the system is made up of?

* **Logical (de)centralization** — do the interface and data structures that the system presents and maintains look more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm? One simple heuristic is: if you cut the system in half, including both providers and users, will both halves continue to fully operate as independent units?
