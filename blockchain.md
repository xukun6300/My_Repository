## Decentralization
There are three main forms of decentralization, or how authority is transferred:

* **Architectural (de)centralization**  — how many physical computers is a system made up of? How many of those computers can it tolerate breaking down at any single time?

* **Political (de)centralization**  — how many individuals or organizations ultimately control the computers that the system is made up of?

* **Logical (de)centralization** — do the interface and data structures that the system presents and maintains look more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm? One simple heuristic is: if you cut the system in half, including both providers and users, will both halves continue to fully operate as independent units?


The problem with centralization is that we are looking at applications as the product, but that’s incorrect. It’s the wrong product. We are the product of the internet. We, the user, are being bought at market price and sold, aggregated, and resold — not unlike financial instruments. **The value lies in predicting user’s actions so those actions can be monetized.**
