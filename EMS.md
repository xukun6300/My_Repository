# Introduction
SAP Entitlement Management ensures even the most creative ideas and business models can be realized with ease by providing a consolidated IT landscape. **It is a SAP Cloud Platform-based solution that streamlines and automates the complex processes related to managing entitlements.** The user-friendly interface, scalability, and flexibility enables accelerated innovation, higher sales and revenues, improved operational efficiency, and increased customer satisfaction.  

When customers purchase digital goods (subscription to Netflix, purchasing SAP S/4 HANA or Software in your Tesla), They only get "rights" to use the product, unlike the ownership in case of physical goods.

These “rights” are called "Entitlements". Entitlements also encapsulate information such as:

A)     What features your subscription has (e.g. 1 screen vs 2 screen, HD / Ultra HD etc.)?

B)     Which machine you can install a software on?

C)    Which region in world, you can access a service to?

Imagine, if you had a snapshot of  

A)     What all products (across business models and product lines) customers have purchased over the years?

B)     What all entitlements customer has, because of these purchases  

C)    Is customer engaged - is it using its entitlements aka features (consuming it)?

Without the central management of entitlements and lack of insights, companies are leaking revenue (inadvertent overuse) or failing to account for the cost.
